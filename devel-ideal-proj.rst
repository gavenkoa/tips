About ideal software development model.
=======================================

This file mainly discuss about open source software project.

Open source.
============

Open source software project have freedom on how organise project workflow and
which development toolchains to use.

Close source.
=============

Close source projects have proprietary nature because of:

 * interest to make money (another parties can not easily reproduce project to
   get monopoly on market)
 * low code quality (to stop stain company good name or to stop malicious
   attacks based on code analysis)
 * security consideration (to hide protocols and data format to make harder
   malicious attack)
 * business model (closed data formats allow vendor lock)

Disadvantages of closed source project (in many case):

 * you can not directly contact with developers (only through support)
 * low support quality (supported ugually don't have tech skills)
 * paid support (and you have no enough money)
 * can not access to product bug tracing system (you only can submit bug via
   crash report application or technical support; publishing internal bugs can
   damage product reputation)
